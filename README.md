# pyBlink
Python Version of the PixInsight Blink tool with a few extras 

To install on a Mac or Linux:

- Clone this repo on your local machine
- Change to the cloned Repo's directory
- Create a venv:

        python3 -m venv .venv
- Activate the venv:

        . ./.venv/bin/activate
- use pip3 to install the required dependencies: 

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Now you are ready.

For future, only change to the Cloned repos directory and do:

    . ./.venv/bin/activate
    python3 pyBlink.py

Have fun!
